# Databricks Notebooks

## Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of Databricks notebooks designed to practice and learn various aspects of Databricks. The notebooks cover a wide range of topics, including data engineering, data analysis, machine learning, and more. Each notebook is crafted to provide hands-on experience with Databricks and its powerful features.

## Technologies Used

- **Databricks**: Unified data analytics platform.
- **Apache Spark**: Distributed data processing engine.
- **Delta Lake**: Storage layer that brings ACID transactions to Apache Spark.
- **Python**: Programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
- **SQL**: Structured Query Language for querying data.
- **JSON**: Data format used in various notebooks for data storage and manipulation.

## Notebooks

- **Data Engineering**: Notebooks focused on building data pipelines, ETL processes, and data transformations.
- **Data Analysis**: Notebooks for querying, analyzing, and visualizing data.
- **Machine Learning**: Notebooks demonstrating machine learning workflows, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Advanced Transformations**: Notebooks showcasing advanced data transformations using Spark SQL and Delta Lake.

## Getting Started

To get started with these notebooks, access to a Databricks workspace is required. Follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to a local machine.
2. Upload the notebooks to a Databricks workspace.
3. Follow the instructions in each notebook to run the code and explore the concepts.
