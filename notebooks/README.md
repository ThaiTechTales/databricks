# Databricks Notebooks

## Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of Databricks notebooks designed to practice and learn various aspects of Databricks. The notebooks cover a wide range of topics, including data engineering, data analysis, machine learning, and more. Each notebook is crafted to provide hands-on experience with Databricks and its powerful features.

## Technologies Used

- **Databricks**: Unified data analytics platform.
- **Apache Spark**: Distributed data processing engine.
- **Delta Lake**: Storage layer that brings ACID transactions to Apache Spark.
- **Python**: Programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
- **SQL**: Structured Query Language for querying data.
- **JSON**: Data format used in various notebooks for data storage and manipulation.

## Notebooks

- **querying:** Notebooks for querying data using SQL and Spark SQL.
- **writing:** Notebooks for writing data to different file formats and storage systems.
- **transformation:** Notebooks for transforming data using Spark transformations and actions.
- **functions:** Notebooks for defining and using functions in Databricks.
- **data-processing:**: Notebooks for data processing tasks, such as data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation.

## Getting Started

To get started with these notebooks, access to a Databricks workspace is required. Follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to a local machine.
2. Upload the notebooks to a Databricks workspace.
3. Follow the instructions in each notebook to run the code and explore the concepts.
